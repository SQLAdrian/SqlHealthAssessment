> Free, open-source SQL Server monitoring, health assessment, and performance analysis tool for Windows DBAs.
> A lightweight alternative to expensive commercial SQL monitoring tools like SolarWinds DPA, Redgate SQL Monitor, SentryOne, and Idera SQL Diagnostic Manager.

**SQL Health Assessment** is a self-contained Windows desktop application that monitors multiple SQL Server instances in real time. It provides live dashboards, health checks, blocking chain analysis, interactive query execution plan viewing, wait-event statistics, vulnerability assessments, and comprehensive audit reports — all from a single executable with no agent installation required on your SQL Servers.

Built on the battle-tested [SQLWATCH](https://github.com/marcingminski/sqlwatch) and [Erik Darling's PerformanceMonitor](https://github.com/erikdarlingdata/DarlingData) frameworks, it combines the best open-source SQL Server diagnostic scripts ([sp_Blitz](https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit), [sp_triage](https://sqldba.org), [MadeiraToolbox](https://github.com/MadeiraData/MadeiraToolbox), [TigerToolbox](https://github.com/microsoft/tigertoolbox)) into a single tool with a modern UI.

### Who is this for?

- **SQL Server DBAs** who need a free monitoring tool that doesn't require complex infrastructure
- **Teams running SQL Server 2016–2022** (on-premises, Azure VM, or Azure SQL Managed Instance)
- **Consultants** who need a portable tool to quickly assess SQL Server health at client sites
- **Organizations** looking for an open-source alternative to SolarWinds, Redgate, SentryOne, or Idera

### What problems does it solve?

- **"What's happening on my SQL Server right now?"** — Live dashboards show active sessions, blocking chains, top queries, and wait stats in real time
- **"Why is my SQL Server slow?"** — Interactive execution plan viewer, wait statistics trends, and long-running query detection
- **"Is my SQL Server healthy?"** — Quick Check (30 seconds) and Full Audit (comprehensive) with exportable results
- **"Is my SQL Server secure?"** — Microsoft SQL Vulnerability Assessment with 500+ security checks
- **"How do I monitor multiple servers?"** — Multi-server support with aggregated views and per-instance drill-down
- **"How do I export audit results to the cloud?"** — Azure Blob Storage integration with automatic CSV upload

---

## Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Dashboards** — configurable panels for sessions, wait events, query stats, and memory pressure
- **Multi-Server Support** — switch between servers or view aggregated data across all instances
- **Always On AG Dashboard** — replica sync status, redo/send queue trends, listener configuration, failover readiness
- **Replication Monitor** — publications, subscriptions, undistributed commands, distribution agent history

### Health & Analysis
- **Quick Check** (`Ctrl+Q`) — instant assessment: CPU, memory, blocking, missing/unused indexes
- **Full Audit** (`Ctrl+4`) — deep-dive covering configuration, security, backups, fragmentation
- **Vulnerability Assessment** — SQL Server security assessment with exportable results
- **Interactive Execution Plan Viewer (V2)** — graphical plan with hover detail pane (object path, cost breakdown, predicate, copy button); root operator always shows 100%; pane fades after 1.5 s with hover-cancel

- **Alert history** — SQLite-backed alert log with acknowledgement and auto-resolution
- **Scheduled tasks** — automated task engine with CSV export, Azure Blob upload, and email delivery

### Performance & Reliability
- **SQLite WAL-mode cache** — panels serve cached data when SQL Server is temporarily unreachable
- **Delta-fetch for time-series** — only new data points are fetched on each refresh
- **Two-tier query throttling** — protects the monitored server from excessive load
- **Zero-allocation row reading** — `ArrayPool<T>` and streaming JSON serialisation
- **Cancellable dashboard loads** — switch servers or hit Cancel to abort in-flight queries instantly

- **Filter by tag or environment** — click-to-filter across the server inventory
- **Connection pool** — configurable pool (default 50 connections) with idle cleanup and overflow handling
- **Blazor Server circuit monitoring** — tracks active circuits with lifecycle logging for long-running server-mode deployments

### Developer Experience
- **JSON-based dashboard editor** — add, reorder, drag-and-drop panels without code changes
- **10 UI themes** — dark and light options, switchable at runtime
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — full keyboard navigation (`Ctrl+1–9`, `?` to show help)
- **Serilog structured logging** — 30-day rolling logs with configurable verbosity

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Download

Grab the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SQLAdrian/SqlHealthAssessment/releases).
Extract the ZIP to a folder, e.g. `C:\Tools\SqlHealthAssessment`.

### 2. Deploy SQLWATCH (first time only)

SQLWATCH is the metrics-collection layer that lives in your SQL Server.

**Option A — from within the app (recommended):**
1. Launch `SqlHealthAssessment.exe`
2. Go to **Database Deploy** in the navigation
3. Enter your server details and click **Deploy**

**Option B — manual SQL scripts:**
```sql
-- Run in order against your target server:
-- 1. SQLWATCH_db\01_CreateSQLWATCHDB.sql
-- 2. SQLWATCH_db\02_PostSQLWATCHDBcreate.sql
```

Or deploy `Dacpacs\SQLWATCH.dacpac` via SSMS (right-click Databases → Deploy Data-tier Application).

### 3. Connect and Monitor

1. Go to **Servers** → **Add Server**
2. Enter the server name and choose Windows or SQL authentication
3. Click **Test Connection**, then **Save**
4. Navigate to **Live Monitor** or **Instance Overview** to start monitoring

## Configuration

All settings live in `appsettings.json` alongside the executable. The most common options:

```json
{
  "RefreshIntervalSeconds": 35,
  "QueryTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "DataRetentionDays": 7,
  "MaxQueryRows": 2000,
  "RateLimiting": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "MaxQueriesPerMinute": 50
  }
}
```

Dashboard layouts are defined in `dashboard-config.json` and can be edited directly in the application under **Dashboard Editor** (`Ctrl+E`).

See the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for the full configuration reference, including enterprise deployment (GPO, SCCM/Intune), security hardening, and backup/recovery procedures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this require installing anything on the SQL Server?**
A: No agent is needed on the SQL Server. The app connects remotely via standard SQL connections. Optionally, you can deploy the SQLWATCH database for historical metrics collection.

**Q: Can I monitor Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance?**
A: Azure SQL Managed Instance is supported. Azure SQL Database (PaaS) has limited support — some DMV-based checks require server-level permissions not available in PaaS.

**Q: Is this a replacement for SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)?**
A: No — it complements SSMS. SQL Health Assessment focuses on monitoring, health checks, and performance analysis. Use SSMS for query authoring, schema management, and administration tasks.

**Q: Can I run this as a Windows Service for 24/7 monitoring?**
A: Yes — the app supports headless Windows Service mode with Kestrel HTTPS for remote dashboard access.

**Q: Are credentials stored securely?**
A: Yes — all passwords are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a machine-scoped DPAPI key. Credentials are tied to the machine and cannot be decrypted on another computer.

**Q: How does this compare to commercial tools like SolarWinds DPA or Redgate SQL Monitor?**
A: SQL Health Assessment is free and open-source with no licensing costs. It covers core monitoring, health checks, execution plans, and wait stats. Commercial tools may offer deeper historical trending, mobile apps, or cloud-hosted dashboards, but this tool handles the majority of day-to-day DBA monitoring needs.

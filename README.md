> **Free, open-source SQL Server monitoring — no agents, no per-server licensing, single exe.**
> A lightweight alternative to SolarWinds DPA, Redgate SQL Monitor, SentryOne, and Idera SQL Diagnostic Manager.

**LiveMonitor** is a Windows desktop application (Blazor UI hosted in WPF) that monitors multiple SQL Server instances in real time. It ships as a single executable and can also run as a headless Windows Service for 24/7 monitoring with remote browser access.

No software is installed on your SQL Servers. Everything runs from your workstation or a dedicated monitoring host.

---

## Quick Start

> **Requires:** Windows 10 1809+ · SQL Server 2016+
> .NET runtime and WebView2 are bundled — no prerequisites to install.

```
1. Download LiveMonitor.exe from the Releases page
2. Run it — no installation needed
3. Go to Servers → Add Server, enter your SQL Server name, click Test → Save
4. Open Live Monitor (Ctrl+2) to see live sessions, wait stats, and top queries
5. Run a Quick Check (Ctrl+Q) for an instant health snapshot
```

First time? The built-in onboarding wizard walks you through the setup in 3 steps.
Need SQLWATCH for historical dashboards? Go to **Database Deploy** — it handles the deployment for you.

- **Organizations** looking for an open-source alternative to expensive commercial monitors

---

## Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Dashboards** — configurable panels for sessions, wait events, query stats, and memory pressure
- **Multi-Server Support** — switch between servers or view aggregated data across all instances
- **Always On AG Dashboard** — replica sync status, redo/send queue trends, listener configuration, failover readiness
- **Replication Monitor** — publications, subscriptions, undistributed commands, distribution agent history
- **SQL Agent Job Monitor** — running/failed/succeeded job counts, failure detail, schedules, long-running job tracking
- **Auto-Refresh** — configurable polling interval with idle-mode throttling
- **Session Viewer** — active sessions with blocking chain analysis and kill capability

### Health & Analysis
- **Quick Check** (`Ctrl+Q`) — instant assessment: CPU, memory, blocking, missing/unused indexes
- **Full Audit** (`Ctrl+4`) — deep-dive covering configuration, security, backups, fragmentation; Sequential or Parallel execution across multiple servers with configurable stagger delay and confirmation modal
- **Vulnerability Assessment** — SQL Server security assessment with exportable results
- **Diagnostics Maturity Roadmap** — maps sp_triage and sp_Blitz audit output to a 5-level maturity framework (Foundation → Hardened → Performant → Observable → Optimised); multi-server, multi-file, PDF export
- **Interactive Execution Plan Viewer (V2)** — graphical plan with hover detail pane (object path, accurate per-operator cost %, predicate, copy button); root operator always shows 100%; pane fades after 1.5 s with hover-cancel; accessible from blocking chains and expensive query grids
- **Long Query Detection** — surface queries exceeding configurable duration thresholds
- **Wait Statistics** — categorised wait event history and trends, including locking-waits %
- **PM Health & Diagnostics** — dedicated dashboard surfacing Erik Darling PerformanceMonitor `report.*` views: critical issues, CPU spikes, memory pressure events, plan cache bloat, memory grant pressure, scheduler runnable queue, parameter sniffing (PSP), file I/O latency, blocking chains with exact statement extraction, and FinOps cost/provisioning/peak-hours analysis

### Alerting & Notifications
- **69 Custom Alerts** — Performance, memory, storage, HA, security with SQL 2016+ compatibility
- **Extended Events Integration** — Real-time deadlock/error monitoring via XE sessions
- **Timer-based evaluation** — 30-second alert cycle with configurable severity thresholds and cooldowns
- **7 notification channels** — Email (SMTP), Microsoft Teams, Slack, generic Webhooks, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, WhatsApp
- **Alert history** — SQLite-backed alert log with acknowledgement and auto-resolution
- **Scheduled tasks** — automated task engine with CSV export, Azure Blob upload, and email delivery
- **No-Pants Mode** — Safety toggle for destructive actions (e.g., kill sessions)

### Performance & Reliability
- **SQLite WAL-mode cache** — panels serve cached data when SQL Server is temporarily unreachable; indexed `fetched_at` on all 6 cache tables for fast eviction scans
- **Delta-fetch for time-series** — only new data points are fetched on each refresh
- **Two-tier query throttling** — protects the monitored server from excessive load
- **Zero-allocation row reading** — `ArrayPool<T>` and streaming JSON serialisation
- **Cancellable dashboard loads** — switch servers or hit Cancel to abort in-flight queries instantly
- **Memory pressure monitoring** — background service alerts and evicts cache under high memory load
- **Server GC + concurrent GC** — tuned for optimal throughput in `runtimeconfig`
- **DataGrid max-height overflow** — dashboard tables cap at 3× their configured panel height with sticky headers; prevents page-layout jitter on result-count changes

### Updates & Maintenance
- **Squirrel.Windows Auto-Updates** — Silent, delta-based updates from GitHub releases; 3-tier extraction fallback (`Expand-Archive` → .NET `ZipFile` → `Shell.Application` COM) for older Windows Server targets
- **Manual ZIP import** — server mode / air-gap: upload a downloaded release ZIP directly via the Service Management page
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** — Automated build, test, and release on version tags

### Data Export
- **Azure Blob Storage integration** — auto-upload audit CSVs with dual-path upload (Azure SDK + AzCopy fallback)
- **SAS token & User Delegation SAS** — supports account-level and directory-scoped SAS tokens
- **Connection diagnostics** — built-in modal to troubleshoot Azure Blob authentication issues
- **Toast notifications** — real-time upload success/failure feedback

### Security
- **AES-256-GCM credential encryption** — machine-scoped DPAPI key file + authenticated encryption; works for interactive and service accounts
- **Ephemeral session keys** — dashboard results encrypted with a per-process key (never persisted)
- **MFA / Azure AD authentication** — supports modern auth via `Azure.Identity`
- **Parameterised queries only** — SQL injection prevention throughout
- **Assembly obfuscation** — ConfuserEx2 (anti-tamper, anti-debug, string encryption). The source code is fully open — the obfuscation protects the compiled binary from trivial tampering, not the source. Build from source for an unobfuscated binary.
- **Audit log** — full query-execution and user-action trail (90-day retention)
- **Rate limiting** — configurable max queries per minute with optional UI warnings
- **Windows Service mode** — headless deployment with Kestrel HTTPS support

### Server Management
- **Server tagging** — assign tags (e.g. `finance`, `critical`, `east-us`) and environment labels (Production, Staging, Dev, QA, DR)
- **Filter by tag or environment** — click-to-filter across the server inventory
- **Connection pool** — configurable pool (default 50 connections) with idle cleanup and overflow handling
- **Blazor Server circuit monitoring** — tracks active circuits with lifecycle logging for long-running server-mode deployments

### Developer Experience
- **JSON-based dashboard editor** — add, reorder, drag-and-drop panels without code changes
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — full keyboard navigation (`Ctrl+1–9`, `?` to show help)
- **Serilog structured logging** — 30-day rolling logs with configurable verbosity

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|---|---|---|
| **OS** | Windows 10 (1809+) | Windows 11 / Server 2022 |
| **RAM** | 4 GB | 8 GB |
| **Disk** | 500 MB | 2 GB (logs + cache) |
| **SQL Server** | SQL Server 2016 | SQL Server 2019+ |

**.NET runtime and WebView2 are bundled in the download** — there is nothing to install separately. The app runs as a self-contained executable on any supported Windows version.

WebView2 enhances the UI experience when available but is not required — the app falls back to Blazor Server mode automatically.

> Download size is ~120 MB (optimised single-file) or ~350 MB (full with all native binaries). See [FOOTPRINT_REDUCTION_QUICK.md](FOOTPRINT_REDUCTION_QUICK.md) for size options.

### SQL Server Permissions

The monitoring account needs `VIEW SERVER STATE` and `VIEW DATABASE STATE` — standard read-only DMV access. No `sysadmin`, no agent installation on the SQL Server.

---

## Installation

Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/SQLAdrian/SqlHealthAssessment/releases).
Two options are available:

- **`LiveMonitor-Setup.exe`** — guided Inno Setup installer with optional components and a "Launch now" checkbox
- **`LiveMonitor.zip`** — extract to any folder (e.g. `C:\Tools\LiveMonitor`) and run `LiveMonitor.exe`

Both are self-contained. No .NET runtime or WebView2 installation required.

> **First run:** The onboarding wizard appears automatically. It walks you through adding a server, running a Quick Check, and optionally deploying SQLWATCH.

### SQLWATCH (optional — enhances historical dashboards)

LiveMonitor works immediately without SQLWATCH. Adding SQLWATCH to your SQL Server unlocks additional dashboards: Instance Overview trends, PM Health & Diagnostics, Wait Statistics history, and more.

To deploy from within the app: **Database Deploy** → enter credentials → **Deploy**.
Manual: deploy `Dacpacs\SQLWATCH.dacpac` via SSMS or run the scripts in `SQLWATCH_db\` in order.

For SQLWATCH dashboards the monitoring account additionally needs `db_owner` on the SQLWATCH database (or equivalent read rights).

## Configuration

All settings live in `appsettings.json` alongside the executable. The most common options:

```json
{
  "RefreshIntervalSeconds": 35,
  "QueryTimeoutSeconds": 60,
  "DataRetentionDays": 7,
  "MaxQueryRows": 2000,
  "RateLimiting": {
    "Enabled": true,
    "MaxQueriesPerMinute": 50
  }
}
```

Dashboard layouts are defined in `dashboard-config.json` and can be edited directly in the application under **Dashboard Editor** (`Ctrl+E`).

See the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for the full configuration reference, including enterprise deployment (GPO, SCCM/Intune), security hardening, and backup/recovery procedures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this require installing anything on the SQL Server?**
A: No agent is needed on the SQL Server. The app connects remotely via standard SQL connections. Optionally, you can deploy the SQLWATCH database for historical metrics collection.

**Q: Can I monitor Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance?**
A: Azure SQL Managed Instance is supported. Azure SQL Database (PaaS) has limited support — some DMV-based checks require server-level permissions not available in PaaS.

**Q: Is this a replacement for SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio)?**
A: No — it complements SSMS. SQL Health Assessment focuses on monitoring, health checks, and performance analysis. Use SSMS for query authoring, schema management, and administration tasks.

**Q: Can I run this as a Windows Service for 24/7 monitoring?**
A: Yes — the app supports headless Windows Service mode with Kestrel HTTPS for remote dashboard access.

**Q: Are credentials stored securely?**
A: Yes — all passwords are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a machine-scoped DPAPI key. Credentials are tied to the machine and cannot be decrypted on another computer.

**Q: How does this compare to commercial tools like SolarWinds DPA or Redgate SQL Monitor?**
A: SQL Health Assessment is free and open-source with no licensing costs. It covers core monitoring, health checks, execution plans, and wait stats. Commercial tools may offer deeper historical trending, mobile apps, or cloud-hosted dashboards, but this tool handles the majority of day-to-day DBA monitoring needs.

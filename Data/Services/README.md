## Registration

All services are registered in `App.xaml.cs` `ConfigureServices` via `services.AddSingleton<T>()` or `services.AddScoped<T>()`.

## Conventions

- Services are stateless by default; singletons via DI, scoped where per-circuit state is needed.
- Async methods return `Task<T>`; synchronous wrappers are avoided.
- Constructor injection only; services declare dependencies through their constructor signature.
- Services log errors via `ILogger<T>` and re-throw; callers handle user-facing messaging.

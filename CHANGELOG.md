## [0.80.0] — 2026-03-26

**Enterprise monitoring, multi-channel alerting, and server management release.**

### Added
- **Replication Monitor dashboard** — publications, subscriptions, undistributed commands, and distribution agent history from `distribution` database DMVs

- **Blazor Circuit Handler** — logs circuit open/close/reconnect/disconnect with active circuit count for server-mode diagnostics
- **SQLDBA.ORG quick-setup** — one-click Azure Blob Export configuration with consent modal listing shared data categories
- **Browser print fallback** — `window.print()` PDF export when running in server mode (no WebView2)

### Changed
- **Connection pool default → 50** — increased from 20 for better multi-circuit concurrency in server mode
- **Script timeout default → 900 s** — increased from 300 s to support long-running audit scripts (sp_Blitz, sp_triage)
- **Full Audit row limits removed** — diagnostic scripts now return all rows without truncation
- **Async void handlers eliminated** — CacheEvictionService timer and memory-pressure callbacks now delegate to proper `async Task` methods
- **Teams Adaptive Card** — fixed `$schema` key using Dictionary approach (C# identifiers can't start with `$`)
- **System tray icon** — now extracted from running exe via `Icon.ExtractAssociatedIcon` to match window/taskbar icon
- **About page** — added Alerting & Notifications, Server Management feature cards; added Replication, Always On AG, Job Monitor to dashboard table

## [0.79.0] — 2026-03-23

**Build 616.** Azure Blob integration, UI consistency overhaul, and reliability fixes.

### Added
- **Azure Blob Export — connection diagnostics modal** — displays SAS token parameters (version, services, permissions, expiry), endpoint URL, auth mode, and signature (truncated) for troubleshooting 403/400 errors
- **Azure Blob Export — toast notifications** — real-time success/failure feedback for auto-uploaded audit CSVs (previously logged silently)
- **Azure Blob Export — AzCopy stdout capture** — AzCopy v10 writes errors to stdout, not stderr; now captures both streams concurrently to surface error details
- **Azure Blob Export — directory-scoped SAS support** — removed `CreateIfNotExistsAsync` calls that fail with narrow SAS scopes; falls back from `GetPropertiesAsync` to blob listing
- **Azure Blob Export — container name slash splitting** — `raw/ready` auto-splits into container `raw` with blob prefix `ready/`
- **Settings page — 2-column layout** — small settings groups rendered in a CSS grid for better information density; wide sections (Cache, Azure Blob, Alerting) span full width below
- **Settings page — Azure Blob diagnostics button** — one-click access to the connection diagnostics modal from the Azure Blob settings group
- **SQL Auth error hint** — Servers and Settings pages now show a descriptive hint when SQL Server is configured for Windows-only auth mode
- **Guide page — Alerting & Service Management cards** — new navigation cards for the Alerting Config and Service & Updates pages

### Changed
- **AlertingConfig page** — converted from Tailwind CSS to app's native CSS design system (`.settings-page`, `.settings-group`, `.settings-field`, `.settings-btn`, `.severity-badge`)
- **ServiceManagement page** — converted from Tailwind CSS to app's native CSS design system with CSS variable–based status indicators
- **`MaxCacheSizeBytes` → `MaxCacheSizeMB`** — config key renamed across `appsettings.Production.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`, `CacheEvictionService`, and `CachingQueryExecutor`; values now specified in megabytes
- **Azure SDK container client** — changed from `new BlobContainerClient(sasUri)` to `BlobServiceClient` approach, fixing `InvalidUri` (400) errors
- **AzCopy error capture** — concurrent stdout/stderr reads to prevent process deadlock
- **Startup zoom** — default zoom level changed from 200% to 150% in `user-settings.json`
- **About page** — added Azure Blob Export feature card; updated User Experience section
- **Removed ExportData page** — standalone Azure export page was redundant with Settings auto-upload; removed from nav and codebase

### Fixed
- **Full Audit progress bar** — fixed calculation that showed 200% with single-server runs (1-based index math); clamped to `Math.Min(pct, 100)`
- **Doubled blob name** — `UploadLocalCsvAsync` no longer re-decorates filenames through `BuildBlobName`; prepends blob prefix directly
- **IAsyncDisposable crash on exit** — `App.xaml.cs` now tries `DisposeAsync()` before falling back to `IDisposable.Dispose()`, fixing `ServerModeService` shutdown error
- **Edit server "already exists"** — duplicate-name check moved into the add-new branch only, unblocking edits of existing servers
- **Azure Blob hostname normalization** — strips `.blob.core.windows.net` suffix from account name input

---

## [0.78.6] — 2026-03-13

**Build 282.** Post-release feature expansion and query plan overhaul.

### Added
- **Live Index Health dashboard** (`liveindexes`) — missing index count stat card, high-impact missing indexes grid, indexes with >30% fragmentation, unused index candidates
- **Backup Health dashboard** (`backuphealth`) — databases without a full backup in 7 days, databases without a log backup in 1 hour, last full backup per database, recent backup history grid
- **Live Query Stats dashboard** (`livequerystats`) — plan cache hit ratio, plan count, top queries by CPU / logical reads / duration
- **Live Jobs dashboard** (`livejobs`) — currently running jobs count, failed jobs in last 24 hours, running job detail grid, failure history, all-jobs status grid
- **Live TempDB dashboard** (`livetempdb`) — used MB stat card, version store MB, long-running transaction count, per-file usage, top session consumers, long-transaction detail
- **Locking Waits % stat card** added to Live Wait Stats dashboard — `LCK%` waits as a percentage of total waits, with 10% / 30% colour thresholds
- **Vulnerability Assessment page** — dedicated page for SQL Server security assessment results
- **Query Plan V2 detail pane** — replaces CSS-only tooltip; single shared `position:absolute` pane per canvas at `top:8px; right:8px`; hover-interactable; full object path (database.schema.table), `EstimateExecutions`, individual cost components, predicate text, and warnings
- **Query Plan V2 — root node shows 100%** — the leftmost operator always displays 100.0% cumulative cost regardless of floating-point rounding
- **Query Plan V2 — Copy button** — `fa-solid fa-copy` button in the pane header copies the node details to the clipboard; icon flips to `fa-check` for 1.8 s on success
- **Query Plan V2 — fade on exit** — pane fades out over 1.5 s after the cursor leaves the node; hovering over the pane cancels the fade and restores full opacity
- **Query Plan V2 — extended XML fields** — `EstimateExecutions`, `ObjectDb`, `ObjectSchema`, and `Predicate` extracted by `ExecutionPlanParser` and surfaced in the detail pane
- **Performance Monitor — execution plan viewer** — `query_plan_xml` column in the Expensive Queries grid now shows the plan-badge icon and opens the Query Plan V2 viewer on click (extends `DynamicPanel` candidate-column detection to `query_plan_xml`, `query_plan`, `plan_xml`)
- **Cancellable dashboard loads** — `DynamicDashboard` now uses a `CancellationTokenSource` pattern (`StartLoad()` / `CancelLoad()`); switching servers or triggering a refresh cancels any in-flight queries
- **Cancel button in loading bar** — `fa-solid fa-xmark` button in the dashboard loading indicator allows the user to abort the current load

### Fixed
- `SessionDataService` — broken brace structure left by a partial refactor caused `CS1501` / `CS1513` compile errors; replaced with a clean ternary connection-factory pattern

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-24

**First public production release.** Build 104.

### Added

- **Keyboard shortcut system** — `Ctrl+1–9` for dashboards, `?` for help overlay, `Esc` to close modals
- **Panel maximise / full-screen** — expand any panel to fill the window
- **Delta-fetch for time-series** — subsequent refreshes only retrieve new data points
- **SQLite WAL-mode cache** — offline resilience; panels serve stale data when SQL Server is unreachable
- **Scheduled SQLite maintenance** — automatic VACUUM and OPTIMIZE every 4 hours; integrity check every 6 runs
- **Two-tier query throttle** — separate semaphore limits for heavy and light queries
- **Rate limiter** — configurable max queries per minute with optional popup warning
- **Session idle detection** — polling rate drops automatically when the application window is inactive
- **Memory pressure monitor** — background service that alerts and optionally evicts cache under high memory load
- **DPAPI credential encryption** — connection passwords encrypted at rest via Windows Data Protection API
- **MFA / Azure AD authentication** — modern auth support via `Azure.Identity` (`DefaultAzureCredential`)
- **Audit log** — JSONL-format query execution and user action log, 90-day configurable retention
- **Auto-update check** — notifies when a newer GitHub release is available
- **Automated SQLWATCH deployment** — deploy the SQLWATCH dacpac to a new server directly from the app
- **Multi-server support** — add unlimited server connections; switch via instance dropdown or "All Instances" aggregate view
- **Repository dashboard** — status card for every monitored server on one screen
- **Toast notification system** — non-blocking feedback for background operations
- **Serilog structured logging** — 30-day rolling file logs with configurable verbosity per namespace

### Changed
- Dashboard configuration moved to `dashboard-config.json` (fully editable, hot-reloaded on save)
- Query executor now streams results using `Utf8JsonWriter` to reduce peak memory during large fetches
- Row reading refactored to use `ArrayPool<T>` — eliminates per-row allocations on hot paths
- Cache writes use per-query locks instead of a global lock, reducing write contention
- Server GC + concurrent GC enabled in `runtimeconfig.template.json` for optimal throughput

### Security
- All user-supplied query parameters use `SqlParameter` — no string interpolation in SQL paths
- Connection strings with `enc:` prefix are decrypted at runtime; plain-text passwords are warned against in the UI
- `TrustServerCertificate` defaults to `true` for ease of first use; UI surfaces a warning and a toggle
